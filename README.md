 # Online Lecture Responses 
+ 7/6/20: 
  1. The episode introduces machine learning as answers and data generating rules/relationships instead of a programmer figuring out rules to compute answers. He demonstrates this idea by setting + up a single neuron machine learner which is used to generate the function of a line from a list of values derived from said function. Having only a signle neuron presents a very + simple situation where we see only one rule that presumably will lead to a lot of rules being generated from a large set of neurons interconnected. 
  2. The housing prices for 7 bedrooms was 4.069 and 4.044 hundred thousand dollars. They are different because there is some random element to machine learning (My understanding is that the gradient dissent that informs the next iteration/epoch of the model does not move down the gradient perfectly/deterministically).
  3.
