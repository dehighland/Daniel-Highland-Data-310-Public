  - The episode introduces machine learning as answers and data generating rules instead of a programmer figuring out rules to find answers. He demonstrates this idea by setting + up a single neuron machine learner which is used to generate the function of a line from a list of values derived from said function. Having only a signle neuron presents a very + simple situation where we see only one rule that presumably will lead to a lot of rules being generated from a large set of neurons interconnected.
