AARON BURR:
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

JOHN LAURENS:
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

THOMAS JEFFERSON:
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

JAMES MADISON:
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

BURR:
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

ELIZA HAMILTON:
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (whispering):
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

GEORGE WASHINGTON & COMPANY, BOTH:
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

BURR & COMPANY, BOTH:
There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

COMPANY & HAMILTON, WOMEN, MEN:
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

BURR, MEN, & COMPANY:
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:
We fought with him

LAURENS/PHILIP:
Me? I died for him

WASHINGTON:
Me? I trusted him

ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY/MARIA:
Me? I loved him

BURR:
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

COMPANY:
There's a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait!

BURR:
What's your name, man?

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
An open letter to the fat
Arrogant
Anti-charismatic national embarrassment
Known as President John Adams

ENSABLE VOICE:
Shit

ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
The man's irrational
He claims that I'm in league
With British in some vast international intrigue?
Bitch please!

You wouldn't know what I'm doin'
You're always goin' berserk
But ya never show up to work
Give my regards to Abigail
Next time you write about my lack of moral compass
At least I do my job upon in this rumpus

The line is behind me
I crossed it again while the president lost it again
Aw, such a rough life
Better run to your wife
Now the boss is in Boston again
Let me ask you a question.
Who sits at your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76
And you haven't done anything new since
You're a nuisance with no sense

You'll die of irrelevance
Go ahead, you can call me the devil
You aspire to my level
You inspire to malevolence
Say, "Hi", to the Jeffersons!

And spies all around me
Maybe they can confirm
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term
You fat mother-----!
ENSEMBLE WOMEN, HAMILTON, & DOCTOR:
Stay alive…
Stay alive… (Where’s my son?)
Mr. Hamilton, come in. They brought him in a half an hour ago. He lost a lot of blood on the way over
Stay alive...
Is he alive?

DOCTOR:
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?

DOCTOR:
I’m doing ev’rything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived—

BURR:
How does Hamilton the short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab’net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to

BURR/COMPANY:
The Adams administration!

BURR:
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President

JEFFERSON:
Washington can’t help you now, no more mister nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his taunts

JEFFERSON:
Say what?!

BURR:
Hamilton publishes his response


HAMILTON:
Sit down, John, you fat mother—BLEEP:

BURR:
Hamilton is out of control

MADISON:
This is great! He’s out of power. He holds no office. And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton’s a host unto himself. As long as he can hold a pen, he’s a threat. Let’s let him know what we know
HAMILTON:
Lee, do you yield?

BURR:
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

LAURENS:
I’m satisfied

BURR:
Yes, sir

Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don’t speak for me
Thank you for your service

WASHINGTON:
This war is hard enough
Without infighting—

HAMILTON:
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

WASHINGTON:
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

HAMILTON:
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would’ve shut him up

WASHINGTON:
Son—

HAMILTON:
I’m notcha son—

WASHINGTON:
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING):
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud


WASHINGTON:
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it

HAMILTON:
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have your titles
I don’t have your land
But, if you—

WASHINGTON:
No—

HAMILTON:
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

WASHINGTON:
Or you could die and we need you alive

HAMILTON:
I’m more than willing to die—

WASHINGTON:
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive—

That’s an order from your commander

HAMILTON:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance


In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn’t seem to die

BURR:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE & WASHINGTON/ELIZA/ANGELICA/MARIA:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy…

Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

Meet the latest graduate of King’s College!
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops!
I’m only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday
I would—

ENSEMBLE:
Blow us all away

PHILIP:
Ladies, I’m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd
I can’t have that, I’m making my father proud

MARTHA:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin’ to see a play

PHILIP:
Well, I’ll go visit his box

PHILIP:
Ya’ shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!


GEORGE:
I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true
Your father’s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooooooooh!

PHILIP:
It’s like that?

GEORGE:
Yeah, I don’t fool around
I’m not your little schoolboy friends

That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

I know where to find you, piss off
I’m watchin’ this show now

PHILIP:
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—


HAMILTON:
Slow down

PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel
They don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school

HAMILTON:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

PHILIP:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

HAMILTON:
Where is this happening?

PHILIP:
Across the river, in Jersey

HAMILTON/PHILIP:
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

HAMILTON:
Alright. So this is what you’re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

PHILIP:
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m a goner

HAMILTON:
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor
To take someone’s life, that is something you can’t shake
Philip, your mother can’t take another heartbreak

PHILIP:
Father—

HAMILTON:
Promise me. You don’t want this
Young man’s blood on your conscience

PHILIP:
Okay, I promise

HAMILTON:
Come back home when you’re done
Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

PHILIP:
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I’m a little nervous, but I can’t show it
I’m sorry, I’m a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

GEORGE:
I’d rather skip the pleasantries
Let’s go
Grab your pistol

PHILIP:
Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

Count to ten!

But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable

Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now I’m facing—

JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
Aaron Burr!

JEFFERSON:
With his own faction

MADISON:
He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances

JEFFERSON:
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances


MADISON:
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

JEFFERSON:
And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!

Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you

FULL ENSEMBLE:
Tonight
Washington:
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England
And do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it?
Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
The only person you have to convince is me
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

Jefferson:
When we were on death’s door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds?

Madison:
France

Jefferson:
In return, they didn’t ask for land
Only a promise that we’d lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation


Ensemble:
Ooh!!

Jefferson:
Hey, and if ya don’t know, now ya know, Mr. President

Washington:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response

Hamilton:
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?”
“Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead.”

Washington:
Enough. Hamilton is right

Jefferson:
Mr. President—

Washington:
We’re too fragile to start another fight


Jefferson:
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

Washington:
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em

Jefferson:
The people are leading—

Washington:
The people are rioting
There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton

Hamilton:
Sir

Washington:
Draft a statement of neutrality

Jefferson:
Did you forget Lafayette?

Hamilton:
What?


Jefferson:
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget

Hamilton:
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line?

Jefferson:
So quick-witted

Hamilton:
Alas, I admit it

Jefferson:
I bet you were quite a lawyer

Hamilton:
My defendants got acquitted

Jefferson:
Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you

Hamilton:
What?

Jefferson:
You’re nothing without Washington behind you

Washington:
Hamilton!

Jefferson:
Daddy’s calling!
BURR:
How does Hamilton
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he’s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens—

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

BURR:
You’ve kept me from—

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happens

BURR:
For the last time

Dear Alexander:


I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me “amoral,”
A “dangerous disgrace,”
If you’ve got something to say
Name a time and place
Face to face

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Burr

HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President:

I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements


BURR:
Sweet Jesus

HAMILTON:
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic
I don’t wanna fight
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Ham

BURR:
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

HAMILTON:
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself
It’s what you do
I can’t apologize because it’s true


BURR:
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

HAMILTON:
You’re on

BURR AND HAMILTON:
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

HAMILTON:
A dot Ham

BURR:
A dot Burr
ELIZA:
Stay alive…

ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN:
Stay alive…

HAMILTON:
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.”
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

WASHINGTON:
The cavalry’s not coming

HAMILTON:
But, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

HAMILTON:
That’s right

WASHINGTON:
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

HAMILTON:
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

WASHINGTON:
Outrun

HAMILTON:
Outrun

WASHINGTON:
Outlast

HAMILTON:
Outlast

WASHINGTON:
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

HAMILTON:
Chick-a-plao!

WASHINGTON:
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast


HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass!

MULLIGAN:
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

LAFAYETTE:
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

LAURENS:
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day’s a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

HAMILTON:
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev’ry day
“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
And ev’ry day

WASHINGTON:
No

HAMILTON:
He dismisses me out of hand


HAMILTON, LEE, ELIZA/ANGELICA:
Stay alive...
Instead of me, he promotes Charles Lee (Charles Lee)
Makes him second-in-command:

LEE:
I’m a General. Whee!!!!

HAMILTON:
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone with

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

WASHINGTON:
Ev’ryone attack!

LEE:
Retreat!

WASHINGTON:
Attack!

LEE:
Retreat!

WASHINGTON:
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

LEE:
But there’s so many of them!

WASHINGTON:
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
Ready, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Have Lafayette take the lead!

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir!

LAURENS:
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

LAFAYETTE:
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

HAMILTON:
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen:

LEE:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon

COMPANY:
Oo!!

WASHINGTON:
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong

HAMILTON:
But, sir!

WASHINGTON:
We have a war to fight, let’s move along

LAURENS:
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

HAMILTON:
I can’t disobey direct orders

LAURENS:
Then I’ll do it
Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got

HAMILTON:
Laurens, do not throw away your shot
MEN:
One, two, three, four

FULL COMPANY:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE:
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments

FULL COMPANY:

LAURENS:
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

COMPANY:
Number two!

LAURENS:
If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second

HAMILTON:
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned


COMPANY:
Number three!

LEE:
Have your seconds meet face to face

BURR:
Negotiate a peace…

HAMILTON:
Or negotiate a time and place

BURR:
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

COMPANY:
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

LAURENS:
If they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

HAMILTON:
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility


BURR:
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

COMPANY:
Five!

LEE:
Duel before the sun is in the sky

COMPANY:
Pick a place to die where it’s high and dry
Number six!

HAMILTON:
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

COMPANY:
Seven!

LEE:
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment
Of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

COMPANY:
Number eight!


LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR:
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…

BURR:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Aaron Burr, sir

BURR:
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

HAMILTON:
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

BURR:
With his life? We both know that’s absurd, sir

HAMILTON:
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

BURR:
Okay, so we’re doin’ this

COMPANY:
Number nine!

HAMILTON:
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the President
Ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had the chance
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to France
But someone’s gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

COMPANY:

France is following us to revolution
There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up
And the world still spins

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

JEFFERSON:
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, ‘I gotta go
I gotta be in Monticello.’
Now the work at home begins…

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

JEFFERSON:
So what’d I miss?
What’d I miss?
Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss
I’ve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basic’lly missed the late eighties...
I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this…


ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

JEFFERSON:
There’s a letter on my desk from the President
Haven’t even put my bags down yet
Sally be a lamb, darlin’, won’tcha open it?
It says the President’s assembling a cabinet
And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that I’m already Senate-approved...
I just got home and now I’m headed up to New York

ENSEMBLE:
Headin’ to New York!
Headin’ to New York!

JEFFERSON & ENSEMBLE:
Lookin’ at the rolling fields
I can’t believe that we are free (Believe that we are free)
Ready to face
Whatever’s awaiting
Me in N.Y.C. (Me in N.Y.C.)
But who’s waitin’ for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face
He grabs my arm and
I respond
“What’s goin’ on?”
(Aaa-ooo!)


MADISON:
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation’s very soul
Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

MADISON:
Hamilton’s new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control
I’ve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

JEFFERSON:
Uh...France

ENSEMBLE:
Aaa-ooo!

MADISON:
We have to win

JEFFERSON & ENSEMBLE:
What’d I miss?
Wha? Wha? What’d I miss?
What’d I miss?
I’ve come home to this?
Headfirst into a political abyss!
Headfirst, into the abyss!
I have my first cabinet meeting today
Chik-a-pow!
I guess I better think of something to say
I’m already on my way (On my way)
Let’s get to the bottom of this… (What did I miss?)
Ahhh ah!

WASHINGTON:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

HAMILTON:
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

COMPANY:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you’ve been off in Paris for so long!

JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?
HAMILTON:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

WASHINGTON:
I know you’re busy

HAMILTON:
What do you need, sir? Sir?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna give you a word of warning

HAMILTON:
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

WASHINGTON:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

HAMILTON:
You’re kidding

WASHINGTON:
I need a favor

HAMILTON:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior


WASHINGTON:
Shh. Talk less

HAMILTON:
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—

WASHINGTON:
I need you to draft an address

HAMILTON:
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—

WASHINGTON:
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President

HAMILTON:
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

WASHINGTON:
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President

HAMILTON:
I’m sorry, what?

WASHINGTON:
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I


HAMILTON:
No, sir, why?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna talk about neutrality

HAMILTON:
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—

WASHINGTON:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

HAMILTON:
But—

WASHINGTON:
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

HAMILTON:
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve—

WASHINGTON:
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I—


HAMILTON:
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

WASHINGTON:
No, they will see we’re strong

HAMILTON:
Your position is so unique

WASHINGTON:
So I’ll use it to move them along

HAMILTON:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

WASHINGTON:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

HAMILTON:
One last time

HAMILTON:
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

HAMILTON & WASHINGTON:
The hope (The hope)
That my country will
View them with indulgence; (View them with indulgence)
And that
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal (After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal)

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words don’t reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when you’re in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE:
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

HAMILTON:
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it’s quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself, have pity


HAMILTON:
Philip, you would like it uptown
It’s quiet uptown

ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
He is working through the unimaginable

ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
His hair has gone grey. He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

HAMILTON:
You knock me out, I fall apart

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
Can you imagine?

HAMILTON:
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out. That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He’d be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges we’re facing
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
And you need time
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough


COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity

HAMILTON:
Eliza, do you like it uptown? It’s quiet uptown

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

HAMILTON:
Look around, look around, Eliza

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
They are trying to do the unimaginable

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words don’t reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza’s side
She takes his hand


ELIZA:
It’s quiet uptown

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA):
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity
They are going through the unimaginable

Number one!

BURR:
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

BURR AND COMPANY:
Number two!

BURR:
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

COMPANY:
Number three!


BURR:
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

COMPANY:
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

BURR:
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

COMPANY:
Five!

BURR:
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

BURR AND PHILIP & HAMILTON:
Near the same spot (Near the same spot)
Your son died, is that (My son died, is that)
Why—(Why—)


COMPANY:
Six!

BURR:
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

COMPANY:
Seven!

BURR:
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

COMPANY:
Number eight!

BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN:
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

BURR:
They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter


COMPANY:
Number nine!

BURR:
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

COMPANY:
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side

Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza

My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

BURR AND COMPANY:
He aims his pistol at the sky—

BURR:
Wait!

BURR:
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

COMPANY:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

BURR:
I hear wailing in the streets

COMPANY:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

BURR:
Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”

COMPANY:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

BURR:
They say

BURR AND ANGELICA:
Angelica and Eliza—

BURR:
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I should’ve known
I should’ve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
BURR:
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

JEFFERSON:
Ev’ry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin’ for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

JEFFERSON AND BURR:
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side


Look back at the Bill of Rights

MADISON:
Which I wrote

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
The ink hasn’t dried
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

MADISON:
So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size?

BURR:
Look in his eyes!

JEFFERSON:
See how he lies

MADISON:
Follow the scent of his enterprise

JEFFERSON:
Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive


MADISON:
If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it

JEFFERSON:
I have to resign

MADISON:
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

BURR:
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

JEFFERSON:
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse

MADISON AND JEFFERSON:
You can’t put it out from inside the house

JEFFERSON:
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out!

MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON:
Oh!
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose
Oh!
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes
Oh!
Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up against!
Oh!


JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Southern motherfuckin’—

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Democratic-Republicans!

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR/ENSEMBLE:
Oh!

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes

ENSEMBLE:
Oh!

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Because every second the Treasury grows

ENSEMBLE:
Oh!

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton’s misdeeds

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
It must be nice. It must be nice

MADISON:
Follow the money and see where it goes

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
It must be nice. It must be nice

JEFFERSON:
The emperor has no clothes

JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
We won’t be invisible. We won’t be denied
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
BURR:
Ah, Mister Secretary

HAMILTON:
Mister Burr, sir

BURR:
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

HAMILTON:
No

BURR:
You know Clermont Street?

HAMILTON:
Yeah

BURR:
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

HAMILTON:
Sure

BURR:
And all he had to do was die


HAMILTON:
That’s a lot less work

BURR:
We oughta give it a try

HAMILTON:
Ha

BURR:
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?

HAMILTON:
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you

BURR:
Really?

HAMILTON:
“Talk less. Smile more.”

BURR:
Ha

HAMILTON:
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor


BURR:
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

HAMILTON:
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

MADISON:
Hamilton!

HAMILTON:
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go

BURR:
But—

HAMILTON:
Decisions are happening over dinner

BURR:
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Diametric’ly opposed, foes

BURR:
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were


BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Previously closed

ENSEMBLE:
Bros

BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:

BURR & ENSEMBLE:
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
The room where it happened
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
No one really knows how the game is played (Game is played)
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made (How the sausage gets made)
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in
The room where it happens. (The room where it happens.)

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims—

JEFFERSON:
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims—

JEFFERSON:
Alexander said—

HAMILTON:
I’ve nowhere else to turn!

JEFFERSON:
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims—

JEFFERSON:
I approached Madison and said—
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”

BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims—

JEFFERSON:
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

BURR:
But!
No one else was in—

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR:
No one else was in—

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR & COMPANY:
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss (Parties get to yesssss)
The pieces that are sacrificed in (Ev’ry game of chesssss)
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in (The room where it happens)
The room where it happens

BURR AND COMPANY:
Meanwhile—

BURR:
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

COMPANY:
Meanwhile—

BURR:
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

Company screams in chaos

BURR:
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

MADISON:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—

JEFFERSON:
Oh-ho!

MADISON:
A quid pro quo

JEFFERSON:
I suppose

MADISON:
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?

JEFFERSON:
Actually, I would

MADISON:
Well, I propose the Potomac

JEFFERSON:
And you’ll provide him his votes?

MADISON:
Well, we’ll see how it goes

JEFFERSON:
Let’s go

BURR:
No!

COMPANY:
—one else was in
The room where it happened

BURR AND COMPANY:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

BURR:
My God!

BURR AND COMPANY:
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

BURR:
And no one else was in the room where it happened

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

COMPANY:
Alexander Hamilton!

BURR:
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

HAMILTON:
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot

BURR:
You got more than you gave

HAMILTON:
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

HAMILTON AND COMPANY:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

HAMILTON:
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me

HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/
MADISON/WASHINGTON & COMPANY:
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
If you stand for nothing (What do you want, Burr?)
Burr, then what do you fall for? (What do you want?)

BURR:
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

BURR & COMPANY:
I I wanna be in
The room where it happens
Wanna be (The room where it happens)
In the room where it happens (The room where it happens)
I (I wanna be in the room)
Where it happens
I wanna be in the room… (The room where it happens)
Oh (The room where it happens)
Oh (I wanna be in)
The room where it happens
I wanna be (The room where it happens)
I wanna be (The room where it happens)
I’ve got to be (I wanna be in)
I’ve got to be (The room where it happens)
In that room (The room where it happens)
In that big ol’ room (The room where it happens)

COMPANY:
The art of the compromise—

BURR:
Hold your nose and close your eyes

COMPANY:
We want our leaders to save the day—

BURR:
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away

COMPANY:
We dream of a brand new start—

BURR:
But we dream in the dark for the most part

BURR AND COMPANY:
Dark as a tomb where it happens

BURR & COMPANY:
I’ve got to be in
The room… (The room where it happens)
I’ve got to be...
The room where it happens
I’ve got to be...
The room where it happens
Oh, I’ve got to be in
The room where it happens… (The room where it happens)
I’ve got to be, I’ve gotta be (The room where it happens)
I’ve gotta be…
In the room! (I wanna be in the room)
Where it happens!
Click-boom! (Click-boom!)
WASHINGTON:
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Jefferson:

JEFFERSON:
I’ll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldn’t undo it if I tried
And I tried

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Madison:


MADISON:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA:
Every other founding father's story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

BURR:
But when you’re gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

BURR AND MEN:
Who tells your story?
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA AND WOMEN:
Who tells your story?
Your story?


WOMEN:
Eliza

ELIZA:
I put myself back in the narrative

WOMEN:
Eliza

ELIZA:
I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It’s not enough

COMPANY:
Eliza

ELIZA:
I interview every soldier who fought by your side

MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
She tells our story

ELIZA:
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you’re running out of—


ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
I rely on—

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Angelica

ELIZA:
While she’s alive—

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
We tell your story

ELIZA:
She is buried in Trinity Church

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Near you

ELIZA:
When I needed her most, she was right on—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more—”

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

WASHINGTON:
She tells my story

ELIZA:
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

ELIZA:
Will they tell our story?

COMPANY:
Will they tell your story?

ELIZA:
Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?
Will they tell my story?

COMPANY:
Will they tell your story?

ELIZA:
Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—

ELIZA AND COMPANY:
Time

COMPANY:
Will they tell your story?
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
Will they tell your story?
Who lives, who dies—

COMPANY:
Time…
Time…
Time...

FULL COMPANY:
Who tells your story?
BURR:
There’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it

HAMILTON:
I hadn’t slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

MARIA:
I know you are a man of honor
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…

HAMILTON:
She said:

MARIA:
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone
I don’t have the means to go on


HAMILTON:
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

MARIA:
You’re too kind, sir

HAMILTON:
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

MARIA:
This one’s mine, sir

HAMILTON:
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

MARIA:
Stay?

HAMILTON:
Hey…

MARIA:
Hey…


HAMILTON:
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”

MARIA:
Whoa...

HAMILTON:
Nooo, show me how to

HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE:
Say no to this

HAMILTON:
I don’t know how to

HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE:
Say no to this

HAMILTON:
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go


ENSEMBLE:
Go! Go! Go!

HAMILTON:
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…

ENSEMBLE:
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

HAMILTON:
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

JAMES:
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

HAMILTON:
Fuuuu—

JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife

HAMILTON:
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:

MARIA:
No, sir!

HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

MARIA:
Please don’t go, sir!

HAMILTON:
So was your whole story a setup?

MARIA:
I don’t know about any letter!

HAMILTON:
Stop crying
Goddamnit, get up!

MARIA:
I didn’t know any better

HAMILTON:
I am ruined...

MARIA & HAMILTON:
Please don’t leave me with him helpless (I am helpless—how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
I don’t want you
Whatever you want (I don’t want you)

MARIA, HAMILTON, & ENSEMBLE:
If you pay (I don’t…)
You can stay
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this (Say no to this!)
Tonight (I don’t know how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this
'Cause the situation’s helpless (Helpless)
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes” (Whoa!)
How can you (No, show me how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this? (Say no to this)
(Say no to this!)
How can I say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go (Go! Go! Go!)
When her body’s on mine I do not say… (No!)

HAMILTON, MARIA, & ENSEMBLE:
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
Say no to this…
I don’t say no to this (Don’t say no to this)
There is nowhere I can go
Go go go...

JAMES:
So?

HAMILTON:
Nobody needs to know
COMPANY:
The battle of Yorktown. 1781

LAFAYETTE:
Monsieur Hamilton

HAMILTON:
Monsieur Lafayette

LAFAYETTE:
In command where you belong

HAMILTON:
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We’ve had quite a run

LAFAYETTE:
Immigrants:

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
We get the job done

HAMILTON:
So what happens if we win?

LAFAYETTE:
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I’m given the chance


HAMILTON:
We’ll be with you when you do

LAFAYETTE:
Go lead your men

HAMILTON:
See you on the other side

LAFAYETTE:
‘Til we meet again, let’s go!

ENSEMBLE:
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Hey yo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!

HAMILTON:
‘Til the world turns upside down…

ENSEMBLE:
‘Til the world turns upside down!


HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza’s expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE:
What?

HAMILTON:
The bullets out your gun!

ENSEMBLE:
What?

HAMILTON:
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?


ENSEMBLE:
Rochambeau!

HAMILTON:
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry

HAMILTON/LAURENS:
We’ll never be free until we end slavery!

HAMILTON:
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting—

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
In Chesapeake Bay!

HAMILTON:
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That’s right

HAMILTON/COMPANY:
Hercules Mulligan!

MULLIGAN:
A tailor spyin’ on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

COMPANY:
Up

MULLIGAN:
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I’m runnin’ with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin’ it!
See, that’s what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

COMPANY:
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

HAMILTON:
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

LAFAYETTE:
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

MULLIGAN:
And just like that, it’s over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

LAURENS:
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

WASHINGTON:
Not. Yet

HAMILTON:
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they’re singing…

ALL MEN:
The world turned upside down

FULL COMPANY:
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

LAFAYETTE:

SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present “Free Thoughts on the
Proceedings of the Continental Congress!”
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

MULLIGAN:
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

BURR:
Let him be

SEABURY:
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…

HAMILTON & SEABURY:
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams
But the Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face
Heed not the rabble who scream Revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk
And what about Boston? Look at the cost
N' all that we've lost n' you talk about Congress?!
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee
They're playing a dangerous game
But strangely, your mange is the same
I pray the king shows you his mercy
Is he in Jersey?
For shame
For the Revolution
For shame!


COMPANY:
For the revolution!

SEABURY:

Scream—

HAMILTON:
Honestly, look at me, please don’t read!

SEABURY:
Not your interests—

HAMILTON:
Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

BURR:
Alexander, please!

HAMILTON:
Burr, I’d rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties


ENSEMBLE:
Silence! A message from the King!

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to—

HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Rise up!

HAMILTON:
If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or—

HAMILTON/BURR/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Rise up!


HAMILTON:
I will fight for this land
But there’s only one man
Who can give us a command so we can—

WASHINGTON & ENSEMBLE:
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I’m gonna need a right-hand man
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)

WASHINGTON:
Check it—
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I’m the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin’ letters to relatives
Embellishin’ my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…


ENSEMBLE:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I’m
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

WASHINGTON & ENSEMBLE:
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I’m gonna need a right-hand man
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)

HAMILTON:
They’re battering down the Battery check the damages

MULLIGAN:
Rah!

HAMILTON:
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

MULLIGAN:
Rah!

HAMILTON:
Let’s take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won’t abandon ship
Yo, let’s steal their cannons—

MULLIGAN & COMPANY:
Shh-boom! (Boom!)

WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon, we’re abandonin’ Kips Bay and…

Boom!

WASHINGTON:
There’s another ship and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
We just lost the southern tip and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can’t afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they’re skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I’m in dire need of assistance…

BURR:
Your excellency, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Who are you?

BURR:
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

WASHINGTON:
As you were

BURR:
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

WASHINGTON:
Huh

BURR:
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

WASHINGTON:
Yes?

BURR:
Well—

HAMILTON:
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir

HAMILTON & BURR:
We keep meeting

BURR:
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

WASHINGTON:
Burr?

BURR:
Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Close the door on your way out

(Burr exits.)

HAMILTON:
Have I done something wrong, sir?

WASHINGTON:
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

HAMILTON:
Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you…

HAMILTON:
To be their Secretary? I don’t think so

WASHINGTON:
Why’re you upset?

HAMILTON:
I’m not—

WASHINGTON:
It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin’ like a martyr?

HAMILTON:
Yes

WASHINGTON:
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

HAMILTON:
Why are you telling me this?

WASHINGTON:
I’m being honest
I’m working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON:
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry!

HAMILTON:

WASHINGTON:
Son

WASHINGTON & COMPANY:
We are outgunned, outmanned!

HAMILTON:
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

WASHINGTON & COMPANY:
Outnumbered, outplanned!

HAMILTON:
We’ll need some spies on the inside
Some King’s men who might let some things slide

HAMILTON, COMPANY & ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY/WOMEN:
Boom!
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I’ll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys,
Master the element of surprise
Chicka-boom!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
I'll rise above my station, organize your information
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
'Til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

BURR:
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

BURR, MEN, & WOMEN:
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
Preacher, preacher, preacher
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was a genius (genius)
My father commanded respect (respect, respect)
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect


BURR/ENSEMBLE:
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it

Hamilton’s pace is relentless
He wastes no time

ENSEMBLE:
Time
Time

BURR:
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there’s a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit—


BURR & COMPANY:

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

ELIZA:
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume


ELIZA AND WOMEN:
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

ELIZA & ALL WOMEN:
Grab my sister, and whisper, “Yo, this one’s mine.” (Ooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking “What’s she gonna do?” (Ooh)
She grabbed you by the arm, I’m thinkin’ “I’m through” (Ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I’m
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
Oh!
I'm helpless
Yeah, I'm helpless, I know
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless
I'm so into you
Look into your eyes
I am so into you
And the sky's the limit, I'm helpless
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

ANGELICA:
My sister

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

ANGELICA:
I’ll leave you to it

ELIZA AND WOMEN:
One week later


ELIZA:
I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

ANGELICA:
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you would share him

ELIZA & ALL WOMEN:
Ha!
Two weeks later in the living room stressin’ (stressin')
My father’s stone-faced while you’re asking for his blessin’ (blessin')
I’m dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry ‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do (Ooh)
My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking “we’re through”(Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says “Be true” (Ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m
Helpless! (Helpless!)
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless

That boy is mine, that boy is mine
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless, helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

HAMILTON:
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so…

ALL WOMEN, ELIZA, & HAMILTON:
Helpless!
I do, I do, I do, I do!

After the war I went back to New York

HAMILTON:
A-After the war I went back to New York

BURR:
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

HAMILTON:
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

BURR:
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is

BURR & ENSEMBLE:
Non-stop!

HAMILTON:
Gentlemen of the jury, I’m curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we’re making hist’ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind
Deliberation—


ENSEMBLE:
Non-stop!

HAMILTON:
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel—

BURR:
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That’s all you had to say!

HAMILTON:
Okay!
One more thing—

BURR:
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

ENSEMBLE:
Awwww!


BURR with ENSEMBLE:
Why do you write like you’re running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re running out of time?
Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re running out of time
Keep on fighting. In the meantime—

ENSEMBLE:
Non-stop!

HAMILTON:
Corruption’s such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony’s economy’s increasingly stalling and

HAMILTON & BURR & ENSEMBLE:
Honestly, that’s why public service
Seems to be calling me
He's just non-stop!

HAMILTON:
I practiced the law, I practic’ly perfected it
I’ve seen injustice in the world and I’ve corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I’ll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities


ENSEMBLE:
Awww!

BURR:
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

HAMILTON:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention!

BURR:
There as a New York junior delegate:

HAMILTON & COMPANY:
Now what I’m going to say may sound indelicate… (Awwww)

BURR & COMPANY:
Goes and proposes his own form of government! (What?)
His own plan for a new form of government! (What?)

BURR:
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

ENSEMBLE MAN:
Bright young man…

ANOTHER ENSEMBLE MAN:
Yo, who the f is this?

BURR with COMPANY:
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev’ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

COMPANY:
Awww!

BURR & MEN with ALL WOMEN:
Why do you write like it’s
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it’s
Going out of style?

BURR & COMPANY:
Ev’ry day you fight like it’s
Going out of style
Do what you do

BURR:
Alexander?

HAMILTON:
Aaron Burr, sir

BURR:
It’s the middle of the night

HAMILTON:
Can we confer, sir?

BURR:
Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON:
Yes, and it’s important to me

BURR:
What do you need?

HAMILTON:
Burr, you’re a better lawyer than me

BURR:
Okay

HAMILTON:
I know I talk too much, I’m abrasive
You’re incredible in court. You’re succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You’re the solution

BURR:
Who’s your client?

HAMILTON:
The new U.S. Constitution?

BURR:
No

HAMILTON:
Hear me out

BURR:
No way!

HAMILTON:
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

BURR:
No one will read it

HAMILTON:
I disagree

BURR:
And if it fails?

HAMILTON:
Burr, that’s why we need it

BURR:
The constitution’s a mess

HAMILTON:
So it needs amendments

BURR:
It’s full of contradictions

HAMILTON:
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

BURR:
No. No way

HAMILTON:
You’re making a mistake

BURR:
Good night

HAMILTON:
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

BURR:
What?

HAMILTON:
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

BURR:
Of course

HAMILTON:
Then defend it

BURR:
And what if you’re backing the wrong horse?

HAMILTON:
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don’t understand how you stand to the side

BURR with ENSEMBLE, ENSEMBLE:
I’ll keep all my plans close to my chest
Wait for it, wait for it, wait...
I’ll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
I’m taking my time watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow

ANGELICA:
I am sailing off to London
I’m accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there’s no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

HAMILTON:
Angelica

ANGELICA:
Don’t forget to write

ELIZA:
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

BURR:
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

BURR with ALL WOMEN:
How do you write like you’re running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re running out of time?

BURR AND MEN with ALL WOMEN, ALL WOMEN:
Ev’ry day you fight like you’re running out of time
Like you’re running out of time
Are you running out of time?
Awwww!

FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
How do you write like tomorrow won’t arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev’ry second you’re alive?
Ev’ry second you’re alive? Ev’ry second you’re alive?

WASHINGTON:
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I’m asking you to be my right hand man

HAMILTON:
Treasury or State?

WASHINGTON:
I know it’s a lot to ask

HAMILTON:
Treasury or State?

WASHINGTON:
To leave behind the world you know…

HAMILTON:
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

WASHINGTON:
Treasury

HAMILTON:
Let’s go

ELIZA:
Alexander…

HAMILTON:
I have to leave

ELIZA:
Alexander—

HAMILTON:
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

ELIZA:
Helpless…

HAMILTON:
They are asking me to lead

ELIZA:
Look around, isn’t this enough?

ANGELICA & ELIZA:
He will never be satisfied
What would be enough?
He will never be satisfied (to be satisfied)

Isn't this enough?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? (Non-stop)
What would be enough?

Verse 1: KING GEORGE:
You say
The price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you’re making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man
You’ll be back, soon you’ll see
You’ll remember you belong to me
You’ll be back, time will tell
You’ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

Chorus: KING GEORGE :
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da…

Verse 2: KING GEORGE:
You say our love is draining and you can’t go on
You’ll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don’t change the subject
Cuz you’re my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…


Verse 3: KING GEORGE:
You’ll be back like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love, for your praise
And I’ll love you till my dying days
When you’re gone, I’ll go mad
So don’t throw away this thing we had
Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love

BURR:
There’s nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin’ it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at—

COMPANY:

Daddy said to be home by sundown

ANGELICA:
Daddy doesn’t need to know

PEGGY:
Daddy said not to go downtown

ELIZA:
Like I said, you’re free to go


ANGELICA:
But—look around, look around, the
Revolution’s happening in New York

SCHUYLER SISTERS AND COMPANY:

ANGELICA:
New ideas in the air

ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY with COMPANY:
Whooaaaaa!
Work!

BURR:
Wooh! There’s nothin’ like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin’ pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy’s got money
Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA:
Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ah, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

ANGELICA:
I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal”

ANGELICA:
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson

COMPANY:
Unh!

ANGELICA:
I’m ‘a compel him to include women in the sequel!

WOMEN:
Work!

ELIZA:
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!

ELIZA/PEGGY:
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!

ELIZA/ANGELICA/PEGGY:
History is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be
In the greatest city in the world!

SCHUYLER SISTERS AND COMPANY:

LAURENS:
Alright, alright. That’s what I’m talkin’ about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!

ANGELICA, ALL MEN, ALL WOMEN:
A toast to the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!

ANGELICA, ALL MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN:
From your sister
Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!
Who is always by your side
By your side!
By your side!
To your union
To the union! To the revolution!
And the hope that you provide
You provide!
You provide!


ANGELICA, HAMILTON AND MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN:
May you always... (Always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)

Recorded Samples:
Rewind, Rewind
Helpless, sky's, sky's
Drownin' in em
Drownin', rewind

I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I remember that—

ANGELICA:
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place

But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face


I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame

FULL COMPANY:
This is not a game…

HAMILTON:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

ANGELICA:
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself

HAMILTON:
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied

ANGELICA:
Is that right?

HAMILTON:
I have never been satisfied

ANGELICA:
My name is Angelica Schuyler


HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton

ANGELICA:
Where’s your fam’ly from?

HAMILTON:
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…

ANGELICA:
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And I know she is…

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And her eyes are just…

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And I realize

ANGELICA AND COMPANY:
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…

HAMILTON:
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA:
I’m about to change your life

HAMILTON:
Then by all means, lead the way

COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA):
Number one!

ANGELICA:
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

HAMILTON:
Schuyler?

ANGELICA:
My sister

COMPANY:
Number two!

ANGELICA:
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service

HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

ANGELICA:
I’ll leave you to it

COMPANY:
Number three!

ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”

ANGELICA AND COMPANY:
She’d be lying

ANGELICA:
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

ANGELICA:
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

ANGELICA, ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON), ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA):
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!

ANGELICA, ALL MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN:
From your sister
Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!
Who is always by your side
By your side!
By your side!
To your union
To the union! To the revolution!
And the hope that you provide
You provide!
You provide!

ANGELICA, HAMILTON AND MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN:
May you always... (Always)
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied

ANGELICA, MEN, WOMEN:
And I know
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
She'll be happy as his bride
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
And I know
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
Be satisfied
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'ma get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the—

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS:
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are—meant to be…


HAMILTON:
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS:
(He says in parentheses)

HAMILTON:
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

HAMILTON & LAURENS:
And I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
And I'm not throwing away my shot


HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

LAFAYETTE:
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you say, 'anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my—

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN:
Shot!

MULLIGAN:
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a—

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN:
Shot!


LAURENS:
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another—

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN:
Shot!

BURR:
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

HAMILTON:
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

LAURENS:
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

LAURENS & HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN:
Ev'rybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Hey!
Whoa (Whoa)
Woo!
Whoa! (Whoa)
Said let 'em hear ya! (Yea)
Let's go!

LAURENS & COMPANY:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I said shout it to the rooftops!
Whoa!
Said, to the rooftops!
Whoa!
Come on!
Yea
Come on, let's go!

LAURENS:
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE & COMPANY:
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
Rise up! (Rise up!)

HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

HAMILTON AND COMPANY:
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN & ENSEMBLE:
We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
Not throwing away my shot
We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
Not throwing away my shot
We're gonna
We're gonna

HAMILTON & ENSEMBLE:
Time to take a shot! (Rise up)


HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/MULLIGAN & ENSEMBLE:
Time to take a shot! (Rise up)
Time to take a shot! (Rise up)
Take a shot! Ri— ri— ri—
Shot!
Shot!
A-yo it's
Time to take a shot! (Time to take a shot!)
Time to take a shot! (Time to take a shot!)
And I am— (And I am)

HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS:
Not throwin' away my—

COMPANY:
Not throwin' away my shot!
BURR:
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I’m takin this horse by the reins makin’
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I’m

COMPANY:
Lafayette!


LAFAYETTE:
Watch me engagin’ em! Escapin’ em!
Enragin’ em! I’m—

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I go to France for more funds

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I come back with more

LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE:
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

LAFAYETTE:
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:


WASHINGTON:
I know

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, you’re gonna have to use him eventually
What’s he gonna do on the bench? I mean—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance—

WASHINGTON AND COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE & COMPANY:
You wanna fight for your land back? (Hamilton!)

WASHINGTON & WOMEN:
I need my right hand man back! (Hamilton!)

LAFAYETTE, WOMEN, MEN:
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
Get your right hand man back!
Hamilton!
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back
Your right hand man back!
Hamilton!
I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter
Ha—ha—Hamilton
But the sooner the better to get your right hand man back!
Hamilton, ha—ha—

WASHINGTON:
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They’ll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander…
