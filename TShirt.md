# Project 2: Neural Style Transfer T-Shirt Competition

As can be seen in the link above, my methodology was to try various paintings of various styles against a picture of jellyfish I took at an aquarium and Starry Night by Van Gogh.

I picked the jellyfish picture because I figured that our T-Shirt would benefit from minimizing any visual clutter in our final image and the jellyfish image could easily have its background removed. Part of the role the T-Shirt fufills for the Data Science Department is advertising, which I thought would be aided by having a relatively simple and easy to recognize design. The novelty of the jellyfish adds memorability to the shirt; however, this novelty, of course, comes at the cost of the image not really having anything to do with W&M. The lack of a link to W&M is especially prominent in an alternate design I made (number 3), which instead uses an image I took in London that also produced a pretty result when combined with Starry Night.
