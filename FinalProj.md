Problem Statement: 

 - With the massive growth of social media, efforts to programatically determine sentiments in written text have become an increasingly prevalent fixture of machine learning study. While this technology has wide ranging applications, the insights into public health and psychology are perhaps its most beneficial use. Using the works of Edgar Allan Poe as a test case, I hope to demonstrate the viability of natural language processing and sentiment analysis in tracking his mental decline through sublte changes in his vocabulary over time. By studying an intensively biographed indivual, we can measure the accuracy of our sentiment analysis against known events in Poe's life.
